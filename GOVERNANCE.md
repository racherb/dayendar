# Governance

This project is governed under a meritocracy model where decisions are made by consensus based on proven experience and skills of active community members.

## Roles

- **Maintainers**: Experienced contributors responsible for reviewing and approving changes to code and documentation. They should have a track record of quality contributions and demonstrated technical judgement.
- **Project Leader**: A maintainer chosen by consensus to represent the technical vision of the project. The project leader has tie-breaker vote in maintainer decisions.
- **Community**: Users and occasional contributors who report bugs and propose features through issues and pull requests.

## Decision Making

Technical and design decisions are the responsibility of maintainers, always seeking consensus with the community.

Maintainers may accept or reject pull requests by simple majority. The project leader acts as a tie-breaker.

For major changes consensus should be sought among the community through discussion in issues. Maintainers reserve the right to modify or revert changes they consider harmful.

Changes to this governance document must be approved by at least 2/3 of maintainers.

## Adding Maintainers

New maintainers are proposed and voted on by current maintainers with a 2/3 majority approval. Their significant technical contribution to the project should be the primary consideration.

Maintainers can be removed by unanimous vote of other maintainers.

The project leader can resign or be replaced by unanimous vote of the other maintainers.
